Join DIWAN talks: Institutional Solidarity  Friday May 28, 2021 / 18.30 - 20.30 CEST  This Friday, Disarming Design will host DIWAN for a conversation that responds and reflects on institutional solidarity, especially as it has come into focus during the last weeks due to the escalating violence against the Palestinian people. 

We will open up the space across radio waves and digital channels with students, artists and cultural practitioners—independent as well as institutional workers. 

You can listen to and join the conversation at pub.sandberg.nl or via Zoom. Go to w139.nl/diwan for the Zoom link and more info.  The event will be moderated by members of DIWAN, PUB radio and Sandberg students.
