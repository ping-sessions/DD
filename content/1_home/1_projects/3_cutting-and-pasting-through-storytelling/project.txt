During this 5 day workshop participants were invited to develop a proposal for a play that will be performed under the supervision of theatre maker Omima Mussa. Together as a group they were organising a collective brainstorm session kicking off using a game as a way to spark and reawaken our imagination and creativity. “Forced analogy” will be introduced as an artistic method, and used as a strategy to start a collective conversation about topics that will lead us to writing a script. In addition participants will work towards an experimental zine (in any shape or form) that will form the base of the final theatrical piece, created and acted out by the participants.
