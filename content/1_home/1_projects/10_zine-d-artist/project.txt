ZINE D-ARTIST is a zine that combines Sarah’s & Jara’s love for making zines and throwing darts ~

In march 2022 we hosted a two day workshop at W139, where we went through a short exercise that helped us come up with the main content for the zine. 

To begin the participants came up with their own ideas of Home, Sound and Comfort. Together we brainstormed and came up with one word each, based on these topics that were written down on a dart board. The idea was to throw our darts and whatever word it lands on would become part of the narrative and storyline. Lastly we collectively designed a publication by drawing, collaging or writing. Where does home, sound and comfort overlap?
