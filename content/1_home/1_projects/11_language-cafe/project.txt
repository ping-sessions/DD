Language Caf√© is a discussion forum for language, semantics, and translation. Five discussion moments/installations have been organized concentrating on the battle of narratives through terms, introducing new ones, withdrawing existing ones, and sometimes expanding on current meanings. 
 
In its first encounter, The Language of Oppression and Resistance, tackled over four sessions the language used in media, social media, power plays, and the dominant discourse on the Palestine question, as Said put forward. Among the many terms and concepts debated are Nakba, Intifada, and Apartheid.
