TypeLab is a typography-focused alternative learning and experimentation platform at Sandberg Instituut.

TypeLab aims to create an open, accessible, and inclusive space for knowledge and skill-sharing between Sandberg Instituut/Gerrit Rietveld students and the outside world in the shape of workshops, discussions, and consultations.

Believing in the necessity for inclusive learning and open knowledge, all events and activities will be archived and documented on online platforms, in order to open-source education to all Type fanatics inside and outside the school.

TypeLab is managed by Mohamed Gaber and Farah Fayyad as part of PUB, a trans-departmental initiative founded and run by Sandberg students with the hopes of establishing collaborative publishing practices at the university.
