Common Ground
By Saja Amro & Anna Celda 

On the 13th of March 2022 we will gather around the fire and eat the flowers of the earth accompanied by the sour roots that came before them. The roots that nurture us and the flowers we grow into. In the context of “All Good Things Must Begin: Roots and Routes”, we have prepared a feast that looks into the common ground beneath us as Palestinian and Valencian artists and cooks. With our contribution to this event we hope to give space for love to grow around the food we eat together.

SALWA 𝑮𝒂𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒔 create work around themes such as relationality, intergenerational wisdom, heritage, and memories.

As this gathering will be the kick-off of the three SALWA Gatherings, we want to facilitate (intimate) conversations that center solidarity and support within the arts and cultural scene.
